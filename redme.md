## üìåIntroduction
This project demonstrates the setup of a home lab environment for cybersecurity testing, including an attack machine (Kali Linux), a target machine (Windows 10 VM), and a logging system (Splunk) to monitor malicious activities. The project involves:

- Setting up isolated virtual machines.

- Installing and configuring Sysmon for comprehensive log collection.

- Generating and deploying malware using msfvenom.

- Monitoring attacks using Splunk for analysis and detection.

Note: This lab is for educational purposes only. All activities should be conducted in a strictly isolated environment to prevent any unauthorized access or damage to your personal network or data. Do not use these techniques for unauthorized activities.

## üîß Prerequisites

| Requirement           | Description                                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RAM                   | At least 16GB (to comfortably run multiple VMs simultaneously).             |
| Virtualization Software | VMware Workstation (Pro/Player) or VirtualBox. Ensure you are familiar with basic VM operations. |
| Operating Systems     | ISO files for Windows 10 (a non-N edition is generally recommended for broader compatibility) and Kali Linux. |   
| Logging Tools         | Splunk Enterprise (Free/Trial version for home lab) and Sysmon setup files, along with a pre-configured `sysmonconfig.xml`. |
| Internet Connection   | Required for downloading ISOs, tools, updates, and configuration files.     |
| Disk Space            | At least 100GB of free disk space for VM images and logs.                   |


### Network Topology

### Network Topology

Below is a simple network topology illustrating the setup. For optimal lab isolation and communication, it's highly recommended to configure your Virtual Machines with **Host-Only network adapters (VMnet1)**. This ensures they can communicate with each other while being completely isolated from your main home network, which is crucial for security when experimenting with malware.

The Kali Linux machine initiates attacks against the Windows 10 VM. Logs generated by Sysmon on the Windows machine are collected by Splunk running on the Host machine via the Host-Only network for analysis and detection of malicious activities.git
